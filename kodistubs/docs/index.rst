Welcome to Kodistubs documentation!
===================================
(former xbmcstubs)
------------------

Kodi stubs are Python files that can help you develop addons for `Kodi (XBMC)`_ Media Center.
Use them in your favorite :abbr:`IDE (Integrated Developement Environment)`
to enable autocompletion and view docstrings for Kodi Python API functions, classes and methods.

.. note:: Docstrings in Kodistubs may differ from the `official Kodi Python API docs`_.
    Except for `reStructuredText`_ formatting needed for this documentation, docstrings are
    updated using the information taken directly from `Kodi sources`_
    or based on practical experience of addon development.

If you notice discrepancies with the actual state of Kodi Python API, don't hesitate to open issues
or submit pull requests in the Kodistubs Github repo.

.. warning:: Kodistubs are literally stubs and do not include any useful code beyond absolute minimum
    so that not to rise syntax errors.
    Don't try to run your program outside Kodi unless you add some testing code into Kodistubs
    or use some mocking library to mock Kodi Pyhton API.
